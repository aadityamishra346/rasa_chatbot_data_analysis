  utter_data_analyst_works:
  - text: Designing and maintaining data systems and databases; this includes fixing coding errors and other data-related problems. Mining data from primary and secondary sources, then reorganizing said data in a format that can be easily read by either human or machine.
  utter_data_profiling_Vs_data_mining:
  - text: Data mining mines actionable information while making use of sophisticated mathematical algorithms, whereas data profiling derives information about data quality to discover anomalies in the dataset.
  utter_data_analysis_process:
  - text: 'Data analysis generally refers to the process of assembling, cleaning, interpreting, transforming, and modeling data to gain insights or conclusions and generate reports to help businesses become more profitable. '
  utter_data_cleansing:
  - text: "Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or data scrubbing or wrangling, is basically a process of identifying and then modifying, replacing, or deleting the incorrect, incomplete, inaccurate, irrelevant, or missing portions of the data as the need arises. This fundamental element of data science ensures data is correct, consistent, and usable."

  utter_EDA_Exploratory_Data_Analysis:
  - text: "Exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps to understand the data better.
            *It helps you obtain confidence in your data to a point where youâ€™re ready to engage a 
              machine learning algorithm.*It allows you to refine your selection of feature variables that 
              will be used later for model building."

  utter_techniques_used_by_data_analysts:
  - text: "There are majorly five types of sampling methods:
              1.Simple random sampling
              2.Systematic sampling
              3.Cluster sampling
              4.Stratified sampling
              5.Judgmental or purposive sampling"

  utter_data_analytics_in_IT_industry:
  - text: "Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions about that information. The techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption. Data analytics help a business optimize its performance."

          b) Data verification"

  utter_data_collectionPlan:
  - text: "A data collection plan is used to collect all the critical data in a system. It covers :: a)Type of data that needs to be collected or gathered  b)Different data sources for analyzing a data set"


  utter_data_visualization:
  - text: "In simpler terms, data visualization is a graphical representation of information and data. It enables the users to view and analyze data in a smarter way and use technology to draw them into diagrams and charts."
